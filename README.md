# Zellij Configuration

This repository contains configuration files for [Zellij](https://zellij.dev/), a terminal workspace manager.

## Installation

To apply this configuration:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/zellij-config.git ~/.config/zellij
   ```

2. Alternatively, if you already have a Zellij config directory, create a symlink:
   ```bash
   ln -s /path/to/this/repo ~/.config/zellij
   ```

This will statically link the configuration so that any changes you make here are reflected in your Zellij setup.

## Usage

After setting up, run `zellij` to start with the configured settings.
